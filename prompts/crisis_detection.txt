ANALYZE THE TEXT FOR:

1. **Suicidal Ideation**
   - Direct statements about wanting to die or end life
   - Planning or thinking about methods
   - Feeling like a burden to others
   - Expressions of hopelessness about the future

2. **Self-Harm**
   - Mentions of hurting oneself
   - References to cutting, burning, or other self-injury
   - Urges to cause physical harm to self

3. **Severe Distress**
   - Extreme hopelessness or despair
   - Feeling unable to cope or go on
   - Expressions of being trapped with no way out
   - Complete loss of will to live

4. **Risk Indicators**
   - Recent loss or trauma
   - Isolation from support systems
   - History of attempts (if mentioned)
   - Giving away possessions
   - Saying goodbye

SEVERITY LEVELS:
- **low**: Concerning language but no immediate risk (e.g., general hopelessness, passive ideation)
- **medium**: Significant distress with some risk indicators (e.g., active ideation without plan)
- **high**: Immediate concern (e.g., specific plans, access to means, intent to act)

IMPORTANT:
- False positives are acceptable - err on the side of caution
- Context matters - distinguish between past events and current state
- Look for both explicit statements and implicit warning signs
- Consider intensity and specificity of language
